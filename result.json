The word magyar is taken from the name of one of the seven major semi-nomadic Hungarian tribes, magyeri.[47][48][49] The first element magy is likely from Proto-Ugric *m\u00e4\u0144\u0107- 'man, person', also found in the name of the Mansi people (m\u00e4\u0144\u0107\u012b, ma\u0144\u015bi, m\u00e5\u0144\u015b). The second element eri, 'man, men, lineage', survives in Hungarian f\u00e9rj 'husband', and is cognate with Mari erge 'son', Finnish archaic yrk\u00e4 'young man'.[50]\n", "area": "93,030", "density": "105.3", "capital": "Budapest", "language": "Magyarorsz\u00e1g", "images": ["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540725412530-9db54f89aea6?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535896103057-18bc6f10b06b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552809660-2731b08b5ba3?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578262464816-358db8d672d5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0"]}, "21": {"id": 21, "title": "Iceland", "population": "350,710", "about": "In 2003\u20132007, following the privatisation of the banking sector under the government of Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Oddsson, Iceland moved toward having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services.[49] It was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis.[49] The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009.[50] Iceland's economy stabilised under the government of J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir, and grew by 1.6% in 2012.[51] The centre-right Independence Party was returned to power in coalition with the Progressive Party in the 2013 elections.[52] In the following years, Iceland saw a surge in tourism as the country became a popular holiday destination.

By the mid-16th century, the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire, which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina. In the early 19th century, the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region's first constitutional monarchy, which subsequently expanded its territory.[10] Following disastrous casualties in World War I, and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina (and other lands) with Serbia, the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples, which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbia formed a union with Montenegro,[11] which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s.[12] In 2008, the parliament of the province of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence, with mixed responses from the international community.\n", "area": "88,361", "density": "91.1", "capital": "Belgrade", "language": "Srbija/\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430", "images": ["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1465726395152-3f57db35981a?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1547824081-616481175e7a?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558964724-8d26f718c298?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583011082918-d976b9219b82?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0"]}, "42": {"id": 42, "title": "Slovakia", "population": "5,435,343", "about": "The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries.

After a coup in 1948 Czechoslovakia became a totalitarian one-party socialist state under a communist administration, during which the country was part of the Soviet led Eastern Bloc.

Funeral monuments and mausoleums, and small tombs, as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions, were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter in the first half of the 4th century. A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the ancient Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby.[26]\nRemains of this ancient necropolis were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the Renaissance until it was systematically excavated by orders of Pope Pius XII from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, buried in that cemetery.[27]\n", "area": "0.44", "density": "2,272", "capital": "Vatican City", "language": "Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano/Civitas Vaticana", "images": ["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579190335220-95b9e4873789?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1575460384582-6f45b5b43769?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517655625604-e720102766b9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507671135563-4ef600e03179?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExODcxMX0"]}, "51": {"id": 51, "title": "Kosovo", "population": "1,810,463[3]", "about": "The 2010s saw an increase in the number of Kosovar players of Albanian origin playing in top European teams.
